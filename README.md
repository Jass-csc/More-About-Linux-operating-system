# More-About-Linux-operating-system

Hello, I am Jaskiran Kaur from the Department of Computer Science Engineering.

FILE SYSTEM SOFTWARE: It is a crucial component of an operating system that manages how data is stored, organized, and retrieved on a storage device (like a hard drive, SSD, USB drive, etc.). Think of it like a librarian in a massive digital library. Without a librarian (the file system), all the books (data) would be scattered randomly, and it would be impossible to find anything.
Here is a diagram of a file system structure:

The file structure starts from a root directory (represented by /) and branches out into subdirectories.

Shells have two types:

    Command-line shells

    Graphical user shells
    We use command-line shells in Linux because, in this type of shell, we use commands. There are various types of command-line shells:

    BOURNE SHELL (sh): It's known for its simplicity, portability, and speed.

    C-SHELL (csh): Its syntax is similar to the C programming language.

    TENEX-C-SHELL (tcsh): It offers more advanced commands for line editing, history, and job control compared to csh.

    KORN-SHELL (ksh): It combined features of 'sh' and 'csh'.

    BOURNE AGAIN SHELL (bash): It is the most popular and widely used shell in Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).

    Z-SHELL (zsh): It is a modern, highly customizable, and powerful shell that builds upon bash, ksh, and tcsh.

    FRIENDLY INTERACTIVE SHELL (fish): It differentiates itself by providing features out of the box.

    DEBIAN ALMQUIST SHELL (dash): It's designed for efficiency and speed.

VIRTUALBOX / VIRTUAL MACHINE:

VirtualBox is a powerful, free, and open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It's classified as a Type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor), meaning it runs on top of an existing operating system (your "host" OS) rather than directly on the hardware.

How VirtualBox Works:
VirtualBox creates a virtual machine (VM), which is essentially a software-based emulation of a physical computer. Within this VM, you can install and run a completely separate operating system, known as the guest operating system.

ISO FILE:
It is a digital copy of a CD/DVD. An ISO file (often called an ISO image) is a single file that is an exact, sector-by-sector copy of an entire optical disc (like a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray).

VMWARE:
VMware's technology allows you to run multiple independent virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical computer (server, desktop, or laptop). This fundamental concept, called virtualization, revolutionized IT infrastructure and enabled the growth of cloud computing.

DUAL BOOT:

"Dual boot" refers to a computer configuration where two different operating systems are installed on the same physical computer. When you start the computer, a special program called a boot loader presents a menu, allowing you to choose which operating system you want to load and use.

BARE METAL INSTALLATION:
"Bare metal installation" refers to the process of installing an operating system (OS) and subsequent software directly onto a physical computer's hardware, without any intervening layer like a hypervisor (virtualization software) or another operating system. Essentially, you are setting up a computer from scratch, giving your chosen OS exclusive and direct access to all of the machine's resources.
